          Connecting to the Internet requires a computer, data connection,
          software for access, an ISP account, and a modem or similar equipment.
          Traditional telephone connections use modems to convert digital
          signals to analog signals, while broadband connections are faster and
          can use optical fiber cable, DSL, ISDN, or wireless technology. ISDN
          lines offer faster connection rates than dial-up lines and use
          multiplexing, while DSL divides telephone lines into channels for data
          and phone calls. ADSL is a common form of DSL that prioritizes
          download speeds. Modems or routers are the main connection hardware
          used for ISDN, ADSL, and cable.

      <h2>World Wide Web</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          The World Wide Web (WWW) is a network of sites that can be searched
          and retrieved using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It was
          designed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and scientists at CERN to make it
          easier to retrieve research documentation. Today, millions of websites
          exist for people to find information, share ideas, express opinions,
          learn online, and be entertained. The web uses hyperlinks to join web
          pages together and create websites, with a home page usually being the
          opening page. Newspapers and magazines from all over the world are
          also available on the web.

      <h2>What Is An Intranet</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img src="/images/intranetDiagram.png" alt="internet" width="350" />

        <p class="introPara">
          An intranet is a private network that uses Internet and World Wide Web
          protocols to connect networks. It differs from connected computers in
          a LAN because it follows international standards, such as TCP/IP and
          HTTP, as communication protocols. While intranet users may have access
          to the wider Internet, this access is usually controlled. For example,
          a police department may access databases from the motor registry
          office to form a private intranet. A school-wide network can also
          serve as an example of an intranet, with a proxy server used to
          control access to certain web pages or to speed up access by storing
          frequently used pages. Intranets can be more complex than the Internet
          since they may need to connect several local networks, each using
          different protocols.

      <h2>Email</h2>

      <div>
        <div class="imageContainer">
          <p>
            Email is a popular internet feature for global communication. It
            works like a simple word processor, allowing users to edit, save
            drafts and send messages. The email server controls and stores
            emails, while the local mail client receives and sends messages.
            There are two protocols for storage and retrieval of incoming email:
            post office protocol (POP) and Internet message access protocol
            (IMAP). IMAP is preferred as it is more flexible and allows multiple
            devices to access mail. Email can be accessed using stand-alone
            software or webmail services. An email address consists of a mailbox
            name, an @ sign and a server address. Messages accumulate in a text
            file until the receiver logs in to read them. Emails can be sent to
            thousands of people at once in a bulk mail-out.
          </p>

          <img src="/images/emailApps.jpeg" alt="Email Apps" height="300" />
        </div>

        <h3>Parts of an Email</h3>

        <p>
          Email messages have different fields such as To, CC, BCC, Subject,
          Reply, Reply to all, Forward, and Attachments. Various protocols such
          as SMTP, MIME, POP, and IMAP work together to send and receive emails.
          The email stays on the sender's computer until it is sent, then it
          goes to the service provider's email server, and then to the
          recipient's ISP email server. Email is instant, automatic, and cheaper
          than a phone call, but it requires daily computer logins.
        </p>

        <h3>Email and Viruses</h3>

        <p>
          An email virus is a harmful program contained in an attachment sent
          with an email, often an executable file or macro. Macro viruses can
          damage files on the computer's hard drive by copying themselves over
          them. To avoid email viruses, it is best not to open attachments
          unless the sender is recognized, and it is clear they meant to send
          the attachment.
        </p>

        <h3>Spam</h3>

        <p>
          Electronic mailboxes can receive spam or unwanted email messages sent
          by mass marketers who obtain email addresses and add them to their
          mailing lists. Dedicated mail software allows users to create rules to
          prevent spam from appearing in their inbox, such as trapping mail with
          specific keywords in the subject line.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy of Email</h3>

        <p>
          Email is not entirely private, as it is not sealed like a postcard,
          and an incorrect address could result in it being delivered to the
          wrong person, or an ISP may return an automated message stating that
          the message could not be delivered. Schools and employers often have
          regulations that permit them to read emails to prevent unacceptable
          content from being included in emails or attachments.
        </p>

        <h3>Email Passwords</h3>

        <p>
          Maintaining password security is crucial for protecting your email
          from unauthorized access. The password should be memorable but not
          obvious to others, and it's important to exercise caution when using
          the "remember password" feature in your mail software. While it can be
          a time-saver if only one person regularly uses the computer, if you
          don't want others in the household to have access to your email, it's
          essential to keep your password protected.
        </p>

        <h3>Netiquette and Emoticons</h3>

        <p>
          Email communication is widely used due to its fast and convenient
          nature, but it lacks the tone-setting aspect of traditional letter
          writing. As a solution, email users have developed ground rules, such
          as avoiding writing in all capitals and using emoticons or texting
          abbreviations like "LOL" to convey the intended tone and meaning of
          the message.

      <h2>Social Networking</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram,
          and Pinterest have become popular ways to connect with people who
          share common interests or to stay in touch with friends. The 'Like'
          button on Facebook has become a defining feature of the current
          generation, and advertisers use it to collect data on users. However,
          users must be aware that their personal information is being shared
          with others. Collaborative websites like YouTube, Flickr, and
          Wikipedia allow users to contribute to a common body of information,
          resulting in the democratization of the web. Social media is
          increasingly being used in politics and elections. Newsgroups allow
          subscribers to communicate with others who share similar interests,
          with moderated newsgroups being more valuable due to the removal of
          irrelevant or offensive contributions.

        <p>
          Message boards are public forums found on many websites where people
          can post and receive answers. They are accessible from anywhere in the
          world and are similar to newsgroups, but the information is stored on
          a single server maintained by the discussion board's owner.

          A mailing list, also known as a listserv, is a group of email
          addresses recognized as a single entity. Some lists have restrictions
          on the number of participants or qualifications required, such as a
          mailing list for doctors regarding health guidelines. Some mailing
          lists, like newsgroups, are moderated.

        <h3>Blogs</h3>

        <p>
          Blogs, derived from the words 'web' and 'log', became widely popular
          by 2004 and there are now millions of individual blogs. They are
          usually personal websites with text, images, and videos, often in the
          form of a diary or journal. Visitors can interact with the author
          through comments. Some bloggers express controversial views and report
          on current events. The impact of blogging on traditional media is
          still debated. Twitter is a mini-blog service where users can send and
          read messages called tweets, limited to 140 characters and delivered
          to the author's subscribers.

        <h3>Chat Rooms & Forums</h3>

        <p>
          Online chat involves real-time exchange of text messages between
          connected users, but it can be difficult to keep track of the
          conversation. Internet relay chat (IRC) or chat rooms are the most
          popular ways to chat online, but users have no control over who they
          are messaging. Chat sessions may have an operator to monitor the
          conversation and remove disruptive users. Forums, unlike chat, are not
          real-time and allow users to initiate new topics or reply to existing
          ones. Replies are threaded to make conversations easier to follow.

        <h3>Newsgroups</h3>

        <p>
          Newsgroups are one of the oldest methods of communication on the
          Internet. They are public discussions on a particular topic that are
          replicated on many servers around the world. Some newsgroups require a
          password for participation, such as those set up by schools or
          universities. The system relies on many computers, known as Usenet or
          NNTP servers, sharing the task of storing discussions.

        <h3>Conferencing or Webinars</h3>

        <p>
          Conferencing software programs enable virtual meetings between two or
          more users, also known as webinars. Users can communicate through
          moving images and sound using webcams, as well as interactive typing.
          These tutorials are often conducted online, saving organizations money
          on travel costs. With the advent of broadband internet, video
          communication has become increasingly popular, with video chat
          becoming a popular method of online live communication supported by
          applications such as Skype, AIM, and Facetime.

        <h3>VoIP</h3>

        <p>
          VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) services allow telephone voice
          calls to be made over the internet, rather than using regular
          telephone exchanges. Skype is a popular example of a VoIP service,
          allowing users to download an application to their computer and make
          free calls to other Skype users. Skype also offers videoconferencing
          and instant messaging services.

        <h3>Learning Management Systems</h3>

        <p>
          A learning management system (LMS) is an application used for planning
          a learning sequence that typically has two components: content and
          communication. The content component might include lesson material,
          assignments, media, and a record of marks, while the communication
          component might include announcements, mail, discussions, and chats.
          Popular examples include Moodle, LAMS, Blackboard, and Edmodo.

        <h3>Messaging</h3>

        <p>
          Instant messaging (IM) is a faster alternative to email as it allows
          real-time communication and eliminates the need to click "reply" and
          "send." It's not as secure as email, and each service has its own
          protocol, so users cannot communicate across platforms. IM can be used
          for one-on-one conversations, while chat rooms allow multiple users to
          participate in a group conversation. Facebook, Skype, and ICQ are
          examples of IM services, and text messaging and multimedia messaging
          service (MMS) are common examples of IM used with mobile phones.

          fast broadband internet, massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs)
          involving thousands of players simultaneously have developed from
          these early MUD games. Popular online games like World of Warcraft,
          Final Fantasy, Second Life, and The Sims are also discussed. Whole
