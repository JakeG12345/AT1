      <h2>Types of Search Engines</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Search engines are programs that index web pages and allow users to
          search for information using keywords or natural language queries.
          There are three main types of search engines: standard search engines
          like Google and Bing, meta search engines like Dogpile, and
          natural-language-based search engines like Ask and WolframAlpha. While
          standard and meta search engines provide links to matching web pages,
          natural-language-based search engines like WolframAlpha provide direct
          answers to fact-based questions.
        </p>

      <h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <div style="margin-top: 35px">
          <img
            src="/images/metaTags.jpeg"
            alt="Meta Tags in HTML"
            height="200"

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Search engines use different methods such as spiders, crawlers, and
          metatags to index web pages and provide a list of possible matches
          based on the user's search query. The search engine ranks each page
          based on the number of pages that link to it. Refining the search can
          reduce the number of results, and metatags are used to describe the
          main contents of a web page for indexing purposes. However, some
          people misuse metatags by adding popular topics that have nothing to
          do with the page's contents. WolframAlpha is an artificially
          intelligent search engine that uses advanced mathematical software for
          powerful calculations.

      <h2>How Subject Directories Work</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Subject directories and search engines are two distinct tools. A
          directory offers a categorized collection of links grouped by
          subjects, whereas a search engine generates a list of results based on
          keywords. To conduct a search using a directory, the user must select
          the appropriate categories. However, search engines often provide both
          directory and keyword searches.
        </p>

      <h2>Searching Newsgroups and Images</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img src="/images/usenet.jpeg" alt="Usenet" height="200" />

        <p>
          Google is capable of searching Usenet groups to locate relevant
          information that has been shared or discussed in a group conversation.
          When searching for "spamdexing" on the web, Google produced 150,000
          results, but only 4,250 results when searching through groups. It is
          important to choose the search tool that suits your needs.
          Additionally, Google provides an image search feature that allows
          users to search for images based on specific keywords.

      <h2>Research</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Efficient searching on the internet requires using keywords,
          prioritizing important words, using quotation marks for exact
          sequences, and limiting hits by choosing English language and
          excluding certain words. It is important to read a search engine's
          online help before use and to refine searches if too many results
          appear. The reliability of web content can be uncertain, unlike
          curated encyclopedias. However, the web's interactivity through
          hyperlinks is its unique strength.
