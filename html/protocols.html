    <h1>The Internet - Types of Protocols</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Transfer Protocols</h2>
      <p>
        The internet is made up of over 100 protocols, with HTTP, SMTP, and FTP
        being the most common. HTTP is used for the World Wide Web, SMTP for
        email delivery, and FTP for file transfers. FTP allows for the upload
        and download of files, including programs, graphics, sounds, video, and
        text files. Downloads are often restricted and large files are
        compressed to save space on FTP servers. FTP programs are often required
        to upload files for personal websites.

      <h2>Communication Protocols</h2>
      <p>
        The TCP/IP protocol used by every computer on the Internet actually
        consists of two separate protocols. The first is the Internet Protocol,
        which assigns a unique IP address to each computer on the Internet. This
        address consists of four numbers separated by periods.

      <h2>Packets</h2>
      <p>
        Data transmission on the internet involves breaking down messages into
        packets of fewer than 1500 characters each, which are sent via the best
        available route to avoid congestion. These packets are then reassembled
        at their destination using the information in the packet. This method of
        data transmission is called packet-switched networks, which include the
        sender's and receiver's IP addresses, the total number of packets, and
        the number of each packet. TCP/IP is used to transmit data and continues
        to be active until the user logs off the internet.
