    <h1>The Internet - Issues</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          A cookie is a piece of information stored as a text string on a user's
          computer, used to keep track of data needed in the future. When a web
          server sends a cookie, the browser stores it and returns it to the
          server the next time the page is referenced. Cookies are usually used
          to store a user ID, which allows websites to accurately determine the
          number of visitors and which parts of a website are visited by which
          visitors. However, the risk of privacy invasion is great when linking
          data-rich profiles and personal information.

      <h3>Proxy Servers and Firewalls</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img src="/images/firewallDiagram.gif" alt="Cookies" height="200" />

        <p>
          A proxy server can be used to block access to sites or cache
          frequently used data, and can act as a firewall to carefully screen
          all messages. A firewall is a security device used by companies to
          prevent access by those outside the company, and can inform you of
          unwanted intrusions. A cable or ADSL connection allows a home computer
          to have a permanently open connection to the internet, but can also
          allow greater access to your computer from outside, which can lead to
          potential security issues such as viruses or other software code.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Virus Protection</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Computer viruses can spread through infected applications, disks,
          attachments, and downloads, and can damage data on your computer by
          corrupting programs, deleting files, or erasing the entire hard disk.
          Disinfectant or antivirus programs can be used to remove viruses and
          repair damaged files. To protect your computer system, virus
          protection software should be installed to check downloads and
          incoming emails and should be updated regularly to detect new viruses
          automatically.

      <h2>Security - Encryption</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img
          src="/images/encryption.avif"
          alt="Encryption Diagram"
          height="150"
        />
        <p>
          Encryption techniques prevent unauthorized access by converting data
          into an unreadable form without a 'key.' One crucial application of
          encryption is when transmitting credit card numbers for online
          purchases. The security of e-commerce is essential for the continued
          success of online shopping and banking on the internet.

      <h2>Using The Internet Safely</h2>

      <p>
        The Internet is a part of real life and some dangers exist on it, just
        like in the local environment. Chatting with strangers and sharing
        personal information can be dangerous, as it is hard to verify the
        identity of the person on the other end. It is important to keep
        personal information safe and avoid meeting or trading photos with
        strangers. Care needs to be taken while using the Internet, and adults
        should monitor their children's access to it. Additionally, excessive
        Internet use can lead to addiction and negatively impact relationships.

      <h2>Digital Certificates</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img
          src="/images/digitalCertificate.jpeg"
          alt="Digital Certificates"
          height="200"
        />
        <p>
          Certificate authorities issue these documents upon request from users,
          containing their name, serial number, and the authority that issued
          it. These certificates are utilized to confirm the user's identity
          during transactions and are commonly stored on their computer.

      <h2>Truth and The Internet</h2>

      <p>
        The Internet is a vast source of information, but not everything found
        online is true, such as the fictional stories of the Californian VelcroÂ®
        crop and spaghetti harvests. Therefore, users must exercise caution and
        not believe everything they read on the Internet, especially when using
        it for academic or personal research. Unmoderated online encyclopedias
        like Wikipedia may also contain unreliable information, and users should
        verify the credentials of the author(s). The Museum of Hoaxes website is
        an example of this.

      <h2>Privacy</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          An individual working for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) would
          have access to more digital data than what would have been available
          through telephone taps and mail interception in previous years, giving
          them ample opportunity to blackmail someone. If one uses the Internet
          frequently for daily activities, research, or e-commerce, personal
          information such as financial status, family and friends' names, and
          other private details may be gathered by third parties. The Privacy
          Act 1988 (Cwlth) and the NSW Privacy and Personal Information
          Protection Act 1998 have been established to prevent unauthorized
          collection or misuse of personal information.

      <h2>Copyright</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img
          src="/images/australianCopyrightAct.webp"
          alt="Australian Copyright Act"
          height="175"
        />

        <p>
          The content of a web page, including text, graphics, photos, sound,
          videos, and clip art, are typically owned by the creator of the page.
          Just because this content is available on the Internet does not mean
          it can be used freely. The Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cwlth)
          regulates what copying is allowed. Educational institutions and
          government departments pay a fee to the Copyright Agency Limited (CAL)
          for making copies of material, which is then distributed to authors
          and publishers.

      <h2>Equity</h2>

      <p>
        Access to the Internet is not universally available, and not all
        individuals possess the proficiency to navigate the complex tools
        required to efficiently obtain information. Financial constraints or a
        lack of resources may prevent some individuals from obtaining an
        Internet connection or computer. In rural areas and certain countries,
        connectivity can be unreliable or absent altogether. In addition, those
        with disabilities may encounter barriers that impede their ability to
        access information easily. These disparities exemplify issues of equity,
        which maintains that all individuals should have equal opportunities to
        the greatest extent possible. Neglecting these principles can lead to a
        scenario in which only individuals with financial means or educational
        opportunities have access to information and, consequently, positions of
        power and influence.
