      <h2>Developing The Internet</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          In the 1960s, data exchange was possible but unreliable, and a new way
          of sending data was needed. Leonard Kleinrock published the concept of
          packet switching in 1961, which involved splitting data into small
          packets and transmitting them along different routes using routers.
          This was a significant advancement in networking, and in 1969, the
          United States Defense Department's ARPANET linked four computers,
          paving the way for many other institutions to join over the next 20
          years.

          The development of transmission control protocol and Internet protocol
          (TCP/IP) in 1974 allowed for the connection of different networks and
          the birth of the modern internet. The domain name system (DNS) was
          introduced in the early 1980s to divide internet addresses into
          logical groups, and protocols such as HTTP and HTML were developed to
          enable the exchange of images and sounds on the internet. Private
          providers also began offering the public access to the internet,
          leading to the continual upgrading of network infrastructure to
          accommodate the growing number of users and increasing demand for
          high-speed broadband access.

      <h2>Mobile Phones And The Internet</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          In 1996, Nokia launched the Nokia 9000 Communicator; the first mobile
          phone with internet connectivity. However, accessing the Internet on
          mobile devices at that time was still difficult. It wasn't until 1999
          that Japan launched the world's first mobile Internet service. Then,
          in 2001, in the United States, the BlackBerry速 smartphone was
          introduced with most mobile device Internet services using the WAP
          (Wireless Access Protocol) to efficiently operate on small screens and
          tiny keypads. It was soon reported by developing countries that the
          majority of their Internet users accessed the Internet through a
          mobile phone rather than a desktop or laptop computer. By 2008, there
          were more mobile phones with Internet access than personal computers.
          In fact, in many parts of the developing world, there were 10 mobile
          phone users for every personal computer user.
