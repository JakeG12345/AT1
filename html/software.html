    <h1>The Internet - Software</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Browsers</h2>

      <p>
        The two main internet software applications are browsers and email
        clients. Browsers interpret HTML coding to display text, graphics, and
        media, and have become more sophisticated over time, allowing for
        videoconferencing and email functions. Operating systems are trending
        towards full online integration with the web, but require a fast
        internet connection. HTML uses paired tags to describe page content and
        can be created using text editors or special software. Browsers can also
        use scripting languages and plug-ins for additional features such as
        reading PDFs, playing media, and viewing animations. Further details on
        browsers and the web are discussed later in the chapter.
      </p>

      <h3>Style Sheet Languages</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          In the past, HTML tags were used to describe the appearance of every
          part of a web page. However, CSS now takes care of these details by
          defining styles for different parts of a page. CSS allows web
          designers to attach a style sheet that lists font size, color, and
          text alignment. This information is kept in a special area in the
          document and can be replaced by a user's own style sheet. Visually
          impaired users can take advantage of CSS by enlarging font sizes and
          using special colors.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="imageContainer" style="margin-top: 50px">
        <img
          src="/images/markUpLanguage.png"
          alt="HTML Annotation"
          height="700"
        />

        <div>
          <h3>Markup Languages</h3>
          <p>
            Markup languages use tags to annotate text with formatting and
            structure information, defining the hierarchy of headings,
            subheadings, and sections. HTML defines the structure and content of
            web pages, while CSS defines the style and layout. XML is used for
            data exchange and storage, enabling the creation of custom tags and
            attributes. Markup languages are essential for creating structured,
            visually appealing documents and web pages that are readable and
            easy to understand, while also allowing for customization.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Plug-in Technologies</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          A plug-in refers to an application that can be incorporated into a
          browser or added to it, which allows the browser to interact with a
          particular file type. The Flash plug-in, for instance, facilitates the
          viewing of Flash animations in the browser through SWF files
          (pronounced 'swiff').
        </p>

        <img src="/images/swf.jpeg" alt="SWF Logo" height="100" />
      </div>

      <h3>Client-side Scripting</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img
          src="/images/javascriptLogo.png"
          alt="Javascript Logo"
          height="100"
        />

        <p>
          Scripts that run on the user's computer are referred to as client-side
          scripts. JavaScripts, for example, can enhance HTML pages by providing
          additional functionality, such as modifying an image when the user
          hovers over it as an indication to click on the image. Java applets,
          which differ from JavaScript, are another type of client-side
          scripting that can create advanced interactions with web pages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Server-side Scripting</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Scripts that run on the server hosting web pages are known as
          server-side scripts. To enhance the interactivity of web pages, other
          languages such as PHP have been developed to enable dynamic web page
          features. PHP, which stands for Personal Home Page, is widely used
          today. Many popular websites such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and Moodle
          use PHP scripts to present their pages to users.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/php.png"
          alt="PHP Logo"
          height="150"
          style="margin-left: -30px"
        />
      </div>

      <h3>Database Technologies</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <img src="/images/sql.png" alt="SQL Logo" height="100" />
        <p>
          Frequently, it becomes necessary to access data stored in databases.
          In such cases, the SQL (pronounced 'see-kwel') language provides a
          solution by allowing database access, thereby serving as another form
          of server-side technology.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>HTML5</h3>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          HTML5 is a technology that reduces the need for third-party plug-ins,
          such as Flash, to handle multimedia and graphics. It is designed to be
          mobile-friendly and has features such as video and audio support,
          vector graphics, drag and drop, and mathematical formulas.

      <h2>Website Design Tools vs Authoring Software</h2>

      <div class="imageContainer">
        <p>
          Website design tools like IM Creator and SquareSpace allow users to
          create a website without coding, limited to the built-in tools.
          Professional website authoring software like Dreamweaver offer more
          control and require mastery of web-based coding languages. Advanced
          authoring applications can help manage the whole site and check for
          inconsistencies in links.
